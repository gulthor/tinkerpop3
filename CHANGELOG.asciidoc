TinkerPop 3.0.0.M2 (Release Date: NOT RELEASED)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* If the input path of a `GiraphGraphComputer` does not exist, failure happens prior to job submission.
* `SugarPlugin` now has all inefficient methods and Gremlin-Groovy proper is only efficient Groovy techniques.
* Prevent concurrency problems by only modifying bindings within the same thread of execution in the `GremlinExecutor`.
* Calls to `use` on the `DependencyManager` now return the list of `GremlinPlugin` instances to initialize instead of just initializing them automatically because it causes problems with `ScriptEngine` setup if a plugin requires a script to be evaluated and a required dependency is not yet loaded.
* `Traversal.SideEffects` has `getGraph()`, `setGraph()`, and `removeGraph()` default helpers.
* `Traversal.Memory` -> `Traversal.SideEffects` and `GraphComputer.SideEffects` -> `GraphComputer.Memory`.
* `StrategyWrappedVertex` and `StrategyWrappedEdge` properly wrap `Element` objects returned from non-traversal based methods.
* Gremlin-Server now sends a single write with status 200 for Object and empty response messages.
* `GremlinGroovyScriptEngine` allows imports to re-import dependencies added via "use".
* Changed order in which the `GremlinExecutor` is initialized such that dependency loading via "use" are handled first which fixes problems with starting Gremlin Server with `gremlin-server-neo4j.yaml`.
* Corrected issues with the "branch factor" related traversals under `SubgraphStrategy`.  This change also altered the semantics of the `SubgraphStrategy` a bit as it became more restrictive around `Edge` inclusion (requires both vertices to be in the subgraph).
* The Gephi Plugin now visualizes traversals and has numerous configuration options.
* Add more specific features around the types of "identifiers" a graph can support.
* Add a new test graph called `CLASSIC_DOUBLE` that is copy of the `CLASSIC` graph, but represents floats as doubles.  This graph will be the default graph for testing going forward.
* Fix bug in `Neo4jGraph` that was not processing multiple vertex labels properly when doing a `has()` step with `IN`.
* Changed semantics of `@LoadGraphWith` in gremlin-test to only refer to the ability of a test implementation to process the data types of the test graph (not to actually load it).
* `StartStep` is a `SideEffect` as it is a process to get data into the stream (like a keyboard) and more efficient as such.
* Greatly simplified the implementations of `Map`, `FlatMap`, `Filter`, and `SideEffect`.
* `Path` data structure changed to an ordered list of objects with each associated to a `Set<String>` of as-labels.
* All sideEffect-based steps no longer extend `FilterStep` with predicate equal true, but a more efficient `SideEffectStep`.
* `TreeStep` now has `TreeMapReduce` for executing on `GraphComputer`.
* `Neo4jTraversal.cypher()` is fluent throughout.
* Reverted back to TP2 model of `as()` referring to step names, not variable names of sideEffects.
* Updated `AddEdge`-step to support property key/value pairs for appending to newly created edges.
* Renamed `Graph.getFeatures()` to `Graph.features()` to be consistent with other API methods.
* `Vertex` and `Edge` now implement all `GraphTraversal` methods to ensure consistency throughout stack.
* `Neo4jTraversal` is auto-generated from `Neo4jTraversalStub` with technique generalizable to other vendors.
* Added test suite to ensure that all traversals are of the same type: g.V, g.E, g.of(), v.identity(), e.identity(), v-, e-methods.
* Giraph HDFS helpers now support `hdfs.mkdir(string)` and `local.mkdir(string)`
* Added `@OptIn` and `@OptOut` for implementers to specify on their `Graph` implementations for test compliance information.
* `GraphComputer` `Memory` now immutable after computation is complete.
* Dependency grabbing for plugins filter out slf4j logging dependencies so as to avoid multiple bindings with the standard TinkerPop distributions.
* Fixed `GiraphMemory` to be fully consistent with GraphComputer specification.
* Removed fatJar assembly from Giraph-Graph as it is no longed needed with distributed cache model.
* Reworked `GiraphRemoteAcceptor` to provide a `result` variable back to the console with `ComputerResult`.
* `VertexProgram` is not longer `Serializable` (use `loadState` and `storeState` for wire-propagation).
* Moved `GiraphGraph.getOutputGraph()` to `GiraphHelper`.
* Changed `GIRAPH_GREMLIN_HOME` to `GIRAPH_GREMLIN_LIB` to reference directory where jars are to be loaded.
* Updated README with release instructions.

TinkerPop 3.0.0.M1 (Release Date: August 12, 2014)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* First official release of TinkerPop3 and thus, no changes.
